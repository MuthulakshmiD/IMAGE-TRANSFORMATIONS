# IMAGE-TRANSFORMATIONS


## Aim
To perform image transformation such as Translation, Scaling, Shearing, Reflection, Rotation and Cropping using OpenCV and Python.

## Software Required:
Anaconda - Python 3.7
## Algorithm :
### Step 1 :

Import necessary libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib for image processing and visualization.

### Step 2 :


Read the input image using cv2.imread() and store it in a variable for further processing.

### Step 3 :

Apply various transformations like translation, scaling, shearing, reflection, rotation, and cropping by defining corresponding functions:

1.Translation moves the image along the x or y-axis. 2.Scaling resizes the image by scaling factors. 3.Shearing distorts the image along one axis. 4.Reflection flips the image horizontally or vertically. 5.Rotation rotates the image by a given angle.

### Step 4 :


Display the transformed images using Matplotlib for visualization. Convert the BGR image to RGB format to ensure proper color representation.

### Step 5 :


Save or display the final transformed images for analysis and use plt.show() to display them inline in Jupyter or compatible environments.





## Result: 

Thus the different image transformations such as Translation, Scaling, Shearing, Reflection, Rotation and Cropping are done using OpenCV and python programming.
